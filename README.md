This repository contains example code for two blog posts [[1]](http://lestard.eu/2015/generic_repository_part1/)[[2]](http://lestard.eu/2015/generic_repository_part2/)
about a generic implementation of the "Repository Design Pattern" with Java.

There is an in-memory implementation that is intended to be used during the development and for testing purposes
and an JPA based implementation.

Use all the code as you like and tell me if you find it helpful.
If you need to know a license to be able to use the code, use MIT or Apache.
